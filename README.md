# javascript-interface-library #

various classification, validation and utility functions for JavaScript and TypeScript

From time to time, it's necessary to classify and/or validate the values of user inputs, data read from input streams (like files or network connections) or arguments passed as part of a function call. While TypeScript type annotations already eliminate the need for many of these tests, there still exist lots of interfaces to the outer (non-TypeScript) world where value checking remains important.

These situations are, what the `javascript-interface-library` is providing functions for.
